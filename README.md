# CameraCalibrator
Camera calibrator class with OpenCV

Basic on OpenCV 3.0

This is my first try on GitHub.

This is a simple class to calibrate camera with chessboard and undisort the image.

You can calibrate the camera by opening your camera or using a series of pictures.

You can get the camera Matrix and the distCoeffs of 5 parameters.

Write parameters to an XML file using SaveResult function.
 
Use loadXMLFile to load the data before you undisort the image.
